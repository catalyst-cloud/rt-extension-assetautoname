See upstream README file for configuration and usage instruction.
Almost all information from that file is relevant.  However, from
the section "INSTALLATION", only this is relevant:

  * Edit a file like e.g. /etc/request-tracker4/RT_SiteConfig.d/90-local.pm
    and add the line:

      Plugin('RT::Extension::AssetAutoName');

  * Clear your mason cache

      rm -rf /var/cache/request-tracker4/mason_data/obj

  * Restart your webserver
