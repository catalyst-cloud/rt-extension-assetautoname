NAME
    RT-Extension-AssetAutoName - Auto generate a name for an asset

DESCRIPTION
    This extension allows you to define templates to use for asset
    categories that will be used if no name is set on an asset. You can use
    this to generate the name based on CustomFields (or other values).

    This was developed for tracking components of servers where the name
    should be based on the make, model and serial number of a component. Yet
    these should be stored individually as Custom Fields to ease searching
    and reporting.

RT VERSION
    Works with RT 4.4.x, not tested with 4.6.x yet.

INSTALLATION
    perl Makefile.PL

        Add this line:

            Plugin('RT::Extension::AssetAutoName');

        Add templates for the categories you'd like to have use this
        extension:

            Set( %AssetAutoName, 2 => 'Card: __CF.28__ (__Status__)' );

        28 is the CustomField to use, you can also specify the name here.
